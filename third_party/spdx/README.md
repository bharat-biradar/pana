# Overview
All the licenses in this directory were obtained from [SPDX](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data)

# Modified licenses
Licenses in the `processed_licenses` directory were originally obtained from [SPDX](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data) with all the text after `END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS` removed.
Optional part of license is removed to provide a better chance of matching incase the input just 
contains the terms and conditions and any other optional part is removed from it.
Code used to modify these license files - [process_licenses.dart](./process_licenses.dart).
